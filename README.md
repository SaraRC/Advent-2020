# Advent-2020
A place to store my solutions for Advent of Code 2020.

I started working on AoC 2020 in mid-December, but shortly thereafter wasn't able to get back to it for a bit.

Now that the dreaded year is in the past and things are calming back down from the holidays, I thought having somewhere to put all these would be nice.

I started out using this as an opportunity to stay sharp on Python, but I'll probably start mixing in a few others soon as well.
